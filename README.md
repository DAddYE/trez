# T-REZ

A super fast image resizer build on top of opencv and jpeg-turbo.

--

This package keeps a good quality of images however is built for _speed_.
It will strip out image informations like IPTC, EXIF, ColorSync profile, etc.

The benchmark below is just _illustrative_.
This code is derived form a production version that process (at peek) more than `1000 images/s` on a
single machine.

## Install

You need:

- opencv
- libjpeg (jpeg-turbo suggested)
- libpng (optional if you want to read png files)

### Macintosh

If you are on a mac and you have [brew](http://brew.sh) installed you can use [this
formula](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/DAddYE/bd6a4819ec0bbb2efb0a/raw/opencv.rb)

```
brew install https://gist.githubusercontent.com/DAddYE/bd6a4819ec0bbb2efb0a/raw/opencv.rb
```

### Linux

Install jpeg-turbo from sources:

```
libjpeg-turbo-1.3.1$ ./configure --with-jpeg8 --with-pic && make && sudo make install
```

and then opencv with:

```
opencv-2.4.9$ cmake -DBUILD_JASPER=OFF -DBUILD_JPEG=OFF \
-DJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/libjpeg-turbo/include/ \
-DJPEG_LIBRARY=/opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64/libturbojpeg.a -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF \
-DBUILD_opencv_java=OFF -DWITH_OPENEXR=ON -DWITH_QT=OFF -DWITH_TBB=OFF -DWITH_GSTREAMER=OFF \
-DWITH_GTK=OFF -DWITH_V4L=OFF -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -DBUILD_NEW_PYTHON_SUPPORT=OFF  -DWITH_1394=OFF \
-DWITH_OPENCL=OFF -DENABLE_SSSE3=ON -DENABLE_SSE41=ON -DENABLE_SSE42=ON -DENABLE_AVX=ON -Wno-dev \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
```

Finally:

```
go get github.com/daddye/trez
```

## Features

It supports currently:

- `fit` resize algo
- `fill` resize algo
- `background` color
- `gravity` in case of `fit`
- `quality` of jpeg (default `95`)

## TODO

- `trim` borders
- `enlarge` option

## Acknowledgement

This library while maintain a good quality is meant for _speed_ so thumbnails, so will strip out
unnecessary image informations like IPTC, EXIF, ColorSync profile, etc.
